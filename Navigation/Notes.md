## Lesson 1: How to Solve Problems
- 0. Don't panic!
- 1. What are the inputs?
  - Valid inputs (assumptions)
  - Defensive Programming: Check if inputs are valid! 
  - How are the inputs represented 
- 2. What are the outputs?
- 3. **Solve** the problem!
- 4. Work out examples
  - Gives some test cases 
- 5. Consider systematically how a human solve the problem 
- 6. Write pseudocode 
- 7. Simple mechanical solution
- 5. Develop incrementally in small steps and **test** as we go
  
- Making Progress is Good!
  - Write small bits of code.
  
## Lesson 2: Data Structures 
- Representing a single object
  - Lists: Ordered Data
  - Dictionary: Unordered
