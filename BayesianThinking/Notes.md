Overview
- Allows for uncertainty 
- Core of stats 
- Project Zero
- Basic + Conditional Probability 
- Bayesâ€™ rule 
- Probability distributions 
- Localization
- Project 1 -> 2D histogram filter, implementing localization

Probability: 
- Uncertainty in every part of the car 
- Learning Objectives:
  - Independent Events 
  - Data -> Stats -> Causes
  - Data <- Prob <- Causes 

Conditional Probability:
- P (A | B) - probability of A GIVEN B
  - Sensor measurement of data to make better estimates 
  - = P(A, B) / P(B)
- P(A) - prob of A
- P(-A) - prob of NOT A
- P(A, B) - prob of A AND B
- P(A) = P(A|C) * P(C) + P(A|!C) * P(!C)
- NEXT: P(C|A)???
